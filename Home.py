Mwache catchment covers an area of 3647 km² and stretches across coordinates 38.6327 west,
39.5416 East, and -3.53513 North, -4.10244 South and stretches across Taita Taveta, Kwale, and
Kilifi Counties.
This Catchment which is the source of water for the Mwache dam has undergone significant degradation over the years 
necessitating the need for restoration interventions. 

Key Watershed interventions include:
1. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) techniques; Terracing and soil stabilization, Gabion Construction
2. Livelihood Enhancement; Support for WRUAs, Farmer Field Schools (FFS) and Farmer Led Irrigation Development (FLID)
